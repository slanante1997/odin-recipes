    <h1>Man-eater Boar</h1>
    <img src="https://cdn.donmai.us/sample/9f/ec/__bloodborne_drawn_by_kankan33333__sample-9fec9c4b44d801695baf3a876ad62d26.jpg">
    <p>The Man Eater Boar is a massive and ferocious beast, with bristly black fur and razor-sharp 
        tusks that can shred through armor and flesh alike. It prowls the deep forests and dark 
        valleys, hunting for prey to sate its insatiable hunger. Few who encounter the Man Eater 
        Boar live to tell the tale, as it attacks with brutal speed and savagery, leaving a trail
        of destruction in its wake. Its blood-curdling squeals can be heard from miles away,
        striking fear into the hearts of all who hear them.</p>
